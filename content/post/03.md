Little beauty
Wu Baisong: Chen Xiaoxi, I'm not going to like you

Youth ignorant heart, to grow up after waiting, then after finally return after being apart a long time, from the school to the wedding, lovers, their love is like all the hopes so sweet.

The more I see the back, the more the pain rises to Wu Baisong.

Do not love anymore
"Like the multiplication, as long as one side is zero, the result is zero", using this sentence to describe Wu Baisong's feelings to Chen Xiaoxi is no longer appropriate.

In order to like, we do stupid things, like Wu Baisong, hope you know, and fear you know. Can only silently follow you behind, like the shadow after the light of the sleepwalking

In the period of young age, the love that does not take care of himself, take out all the courage to express, unreserved to like, pure warm.

The reason why we hurt Wu Baisong is that Wu Baisong in the story is like us in the same year.

Knowing that the other person does not like to be on his own, but still to pay without regrets, as "the bell without brilliant" singing,

"I will love it without your permission; I am willing to be a vice car, and I will be happy and sob."

After all, like a person, it is not what we can control.

No way, since wishful thinking, have to admit defeat.

But put down does not mean to give up love, just say, there is no need to be together.

There are so many things in the world that we can struggle by hard work, but only for love, since we can't get it, then let's let it go.

Not to respond also never mind ah, it is better to cool off, after all, love a person, is to forgive.

People come and go, the city is generous with the night

Like a teenager, do not fear the years

The meeting is too short to wait for the cool tea

## 小美好

吴柏松：陈小希，我已经不打算喜欢你了

青春时的懵懂心动，到长大后的执着等待，再到久别重逢后的终于归来，从校服到婚纱，有情人终成眷属，他们的爱情就像是所有人憧憬的那样甜蜜。

只是越看到后面，越发心疼起吴柏松起来...


### 不爱了

“喜欢就像乘法一样，只要一方为零，结果便为零”，用这句话来形容吴柏松对陈小希的感情再合适不过了。

为了喜欢，我们做尽了傻事，就像吴柏松那样，希望你知道，又害怕你知道。只能默默跟在你身后，像影子追着光梦游

年少时期奋不顾身的爱，拿出所有的勇气去表达，毫无保留的去喜欢，纯粹热烈。

我们之所以心疼吴柏松，是因为故事里的吴柏松，像极了当年的我们。

明知对方不会喜欢上自己的，但还是无怨无悔的付出着，正如《钟无艳》唱的，

“没有得你的允许，我都会爱下去；我甘于当副车，也是快乐着唏嘘。”

毕竟，喜欢一个人，本来就不是我们可以控制的事。

没办法，既然一厢情愿，就得愿赌服输。

但放下并不代表着放弃喜欢，只是说，没有非要在一起不可的念头了。

世界上有很多东西我们可以靠艰苦奋斗得来，可唯独对于爱情，既然得不到的话，那么，就不如放手吧。

得不到回应也没关系啊，不如潇洒地走掉，毕竟喜欢一个人，就是要愿赌服输。

人来人往，城市慷慨夜光

如同少年，不惧岁月长

相逢太短，等不及茶凉
