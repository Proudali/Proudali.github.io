## 2017-10-01

```
Many years ago, you and the future of you are disappointing to me now?

If it is, I'd like to say sorry to you.

I tried to finish all the people's expectations for me, but I forgot to leave some time to ask myself if I liked it.

Years later, do I live to be the one that I once loved most?

Time flies, summer vacation, a friend asked me three years of university did the most regret and the most regret is what?

I thought, think seriously.

The least regrets are,

At least I never gave up myself and worked hard to be a good person, even if it wasn't enough, but at least I tried!

Perhaps the most regrets is not to take care of yourself.

More than one of the words I have said to me: please, take care of yourself.

Or is it: why can you take care of others so well? But always forget yourself?

I'm not as good as you think, so kind,

Just because I know that when you leave home is a person, really can only one person.

No matter people close to them, such as men and women, sometimes there are places that can't be touched.

Give others a little warmer, maybe I won't feel cold myself.

University, once felt this was a very... The magic words, like Pandora's box, have a deadly appeal to people.

It was later discovered, but so!

It's like graduating, and I think this should be a long, long, long time.

But suddenly it's very close... I've been recalling my college life recently.

What did I look like in the last few years?

Remember a big time, perhaps too sharp, that proud look, let the people can not bear it, do not like it is normal!

I remember someone who briefly appeared in my life told me such a sentence: if one day, all the classmates in the class can recognize your hard work, you will succeed.

Have I ever thought I did it?

But it doesn't matter now. After all, I understand that I didn't live for those who didn't matter. At least I loved and loved me, and kept silent behind me.

## 那年我们

多年前的你和未来的你是否对现在的我感到失望？

如果是，那我想跟你们说声对不起。

我尽力的去完成所有人对我的期望，但忘了留点时间问下自己，是否喜欢这样的自己！

多年后的我，是否活成我曾经最爱的模样？

时光荏苒，暑假的时候，有朋友问我大学三年做过最后悔和最不后悔的事是什么？

我想过，认真的想过，

最不后悔的是，

至少我从未放弃过自己，努力的成为优秀的人，哪怕还不够，但至少我努力过！

最后悔的或许是没有好好照顾自己吧！

不止一个跟我说过这样的一句话：拜托你，照顾好自己吧！

或者是：你为什么能把别人照顾的那么好？却总是把自己忘记了？

我没有你们想象中的那么优秀，那么善良，

只是因为我知道，当你离开家的时候就是一个人，真的只能一个人了。

无论是关系多亲密的人，譬如男女朋友，有些时候也有无法触及到的地方。

多给别人一点温暖，或许我自己也不会感觉到冷吧。

大学，曾经感觉这是个很……神奇的词汇，就好像是潘多拉的盒子一样，对人有着致命的吸引力，

后来才发现，不过如此！

就好像毕业，觉得这个应该是很久很久以后的事情了，

可是突然发现近在咫尺…… 我最近一直在回忆我的大学生活，

我到底因为这几年，过成了什么样子？

记得大一时，或许过于棱角分明，那骄傲的样子，让人受不了吧，不喜欢也是正常！ 

我记得某个在我生命中短暂出现的人跟我说过这样的一句话：如果有一天，班上所有的同学都能认可你的辛苦，那么你就成功了。

我有想过我做到了么？

不过现在想来也无所谓，毕竟，我懂了，我活着不是为了那些无关紧要的人，至少我爱和爱我的人，一直在我身后默默守着我。
